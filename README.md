This repository contains the dataset CoQAR and the code for training and evaluating question rewriting models.
The datasets, as well as model training and evaluation methods are presented in the paper: **CoQAR Question Rewriting on CoQA. Quentin Brabant, Gwenole Lecorve and Lina Rojas-Barahona, to be published in [LREC2022](https://lrec2022.lrec-conf.org/en/)**


# COQAR
CoQAR is a corpus containing 4.5K conversations from the open-source dataset [Conversational Question-Answering dataset CoQA](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/coqa/), for a total of 53K follow-up question-answer pairs. 
In CoQAR each original question was manually annotated with at least 2 at most 3 out-of-context rewritings.
COQAR can be used for (at least) three NLP tasks: question paraphrasing, question rewriting and conversational question answering.

We annotated each original question of CoQA with at least 2 at most 3 out-of-context rewritings.

We assessed the quality of COQAR's annotations by conducting several experiments for question paraphrasing, question rewriting and conversational question answering. Our results support the idea that question rewriting can be used as a preprocessing step for non-conversational question answering models, thereby increasing their performances. 

The code for training and evaluation question rewriting models is in the ``rewriting`` folder.
